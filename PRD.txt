# N-Company CRM (SaaS) – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview

**Product Name:** NCompany CRM (Working Title)
**Type:** Internal SaaS-style CRM + CMS platform
**Primary Users:** Operations Manager, Sales Executives, Finance Team, Support Team, Leadership (CXOs)
**Tech Stack (Planned):**

* Frontend: React
* Backend: FastAPI (phase-wise rollout)
* Database (initial phase): Google Sheets as data source
* Architecture: Modular dashboards + invoice-centric system

### Vision

Build a professional-grade CRM that allows the company to:

* Manage all clients, operations, and invoices from one place
* Track business performance through role-specific dashboards
* Use Google Sheets as the live data source initially
* Later scale into a full backend + database system

The product should feel like a **real SaaS tool**, not a basic dashboard.

---

## 2. Core Principle of the System

### Invoice = Single Source of Truth

* Every invoice will have a **unique invoice number**
* Invoice number will be **manually generated by Operations Manager** (custom format allowed)
* That invoice ID becomes the **primary reference key** across:

  * Sales tracking
  * Finance tracking
  * Operations fulfillment
  * Client history
  * Support tickets

All dashboards must update automatically when a new invoice is generated or modified.

---

## 3. Data Architecture (Phase 1 – Google Sheets Driven)

Google Sheets will act as the backend database.

### Sheets Structure (Separate Sheets per module)

* Sales Sheet
* Purchase / Operations Sheet
* Finance Sheet
* Client Management Sheet
* Support Sheet
* Invoice Master Sheet

Each sheet will be connected to its respective dashboard.

### Common Key Field

All sheets must include:

* Invoice ID (Primary Key)

* Date

This ensures cross-dashboard consistency.
